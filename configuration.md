## Backend Setup

Go to [Talawa-Api Backend](https://github.com/PalisadoesFoundation/talawa-api) and follow the procedure to configure it on your system.

### Hosted Instance

You can also use the hosted instance of mongodb using atlas by
following the given steps.

- Visit [Mongodb Website](https://www.mongodb.com) and signup or create your account
- Configure a cluster and click connect to connect your application
- Configuration string will appear something like this:

```sh
mongodb+srv://<username>:<password>@<cluster_url>/<dbName>?retryWrites=true&w=majority
```

In [Talawa-Api Backend](https://github.com/PalisadoesFoundation/talawa-api), create an env file with the following environment variables:

    1. MONGO_DB_URL
        Database connection string

### Tokens

Do not forget to set ACCESS_TOKEN_SECRET and REFRESH_TOKEN_SECRET. in the .env file will appear like:

```sh
ACCESS_TOKEN_SECRET = mysupersecureaccesstoken
REFRESH_TOKEN_SECRET = mysupersecurerefreshtoken
```

On the `successful` execution, your local server will start running on port 4000. Following output will be shown in terminal:

```sh
[nodemon] 2.0.4
[nodemon] to restart at any time, enter `rs`
[nodemon] watching path(s): *.*
[nodemon] watching extensions: js,graphql,json
[nodemon] starting `node index.js`
ðŸš€ Server ready at http://localhost:4000/graphql
ðŸš€ Subscriptions ready at ws://localhost:4000/graphql
```

You can now open the graphql playground to check the schema design and start playing with graph api's.

## App Setup

Go to [Talawa](https://github.com/PalisadoesFoundation/talawa/blob/master/README.md) and follow the procedure to configure project on your system.
Once the project is configured go to [login_page.dart](https://github.com/PalisadoesFoundation/talawa/blob/master/lib/views/pages/login_signup/login_page.dart)
and perform the following change:

```sh
orgUrl = "${dropdownValue.toLowerCase()}://${urlController.text}/";
```

Now `Run` the app.

## App Url Entry

As the app opens, enter the url:

- Remember you only need to enter `local host` and `Port Number`.
  The [Graphql Client](https://github.com/PalisadoesFoundation/talawa/blob/master/lib/utils/GQLClient.dart)
  is itself configured with `graphql` string at the end to form the uri.
- If you are running app on emulator use `10.0.2.2` inplace of `localhost`. This is done because the local host of the emulator is within the device itself.
  To know more refer [this](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/5528850/how-do-you-connect-localhost-in-the-android-emulator).

```sh
10.0.2.2:4000
```

- If you are running app on real smartphone then use `Network IP` instead of `localhost`

```sh
<IP>:4000
```
